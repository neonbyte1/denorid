## Description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still under development and should under no circumstances be used in any productive environment. One _stable_ component has been released so far, with more to follow in the future.

[git_url]: https://github.com/neonbyte1/denorid
[nest_url]: https://docs.nestjs.com
[deno_url]: https://deno.land

[Denorid][git_url] is _yet another_ framework built on top of [Deno][deno_url] and has been heavily inspired by [Nest][nest_url], which we all love, but was designed for [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en). We don't want to compete with [Nest][nest_url], but rather offer an alternative for [Deno][deno_url].

## License

[Denorid][git_url] is [MIT licensed](LICENSE.md).
