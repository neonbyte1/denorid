[Denorid][git_url] is _yet another_ framework built on top of [Deno][deno_url] and has been heavily inspired by [Nest][nest_url], which we all love, but was designed for [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en). We don't want to compete with [Nest][nest_url], but rather offer an alternative for [Deno][deno_url].

[Denorid][git_url] is [MIT licensed](LICENSE.md).
